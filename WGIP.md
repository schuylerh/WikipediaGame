# Project 3: Wikipedia Game Improvement Proposal
## Proposal to Improve WikipediaGame
The current BFS is one without any heuristics nor word embeddings. I propose to add heuristics to the BFS in order to speed up the process even though it may miss the shortest path. The heuristic I am thinking of is associating links with scores based on how close they are related to the given keywords. The keywords would be from the names of the wikipedia pages at this moment but there could be better ways of coming up with keywords. 

## Pseudo Code
```
Function get_links(page_url, start_page, finish_page):
    # Fetch and parse the page at page_url
    # Extract all links on the page

    # Define keywords based on the start and finish pages
    start_keywords = split the last part of start_page URL by '_'
    finish_keywords = split the last part of finish_page URL by '_'
    keywords = concatenate start_keywords and finish_keywords

    # Assign a score to each link based on the number of keywords it contains
    For each link in links:
        score = count the occurrences of keywords in the link
        Add (link, score) to scored_links

    # Sort the links based on their scores in descending order
    Sort scored_links by score in descending order

    # Get the sorted links
    links = extract the link part from each element in scored_links

    Return links
```
## Progress
### April 4
I've implemented the heuristic described above, a heuristic that prioritizes links based on the number of keywords they contain. The keywords are derived from the start and finish pages. A score is assigned to each link based on how many times the keywords appear on the page. The implementation of this heuristic has brought a significant reduction in search time for certain paths.

Here are some examples: (The time limit was set to 30s)

Costume -> Prison: 30s to 3s

Microsoft -> Greek Language: 30s to 8s

### April 18
I've implemented Milestone 1 and included category matching into the keyword heuristic. get_links is called with four parameters: page_url, start_page, finish_page, and category_dict. The content is parsed. The links that contain Category: are extracted. The function assigns a score based on the number of keywords it contains. The score is incremented by 1 if the link is in the category_dict for the finish_page. A heap is used, and the smallest element is popped first. The scores are stored as a negative value, going down the more occurrences of the keyword.

Costume -> Prison: 1.68s

Microsoft -> Greek Language: Ranges from 8-16s

### April 25
Implemented bidirectional search. One queue from the start page and one queue from the finish page until they both find a common page. When a common page is found, the parents of the finish queue are taken as path from common page to finish page. Found out that for the path to work, the wikipedia feature of "What Links Here" is required to find a path from the common page to the finish page. Might have to search for other solutions.

Microsoft -> Greek Language: 0.5s

### May 2, 2024
Tried implementing a more robust version of the keyword heuristic and utilizing libraries such as word2vec for similarity. However, once implemented, the search duration shot up significantly and would not start processing until minutes later. Believe too much computational power is needed to load the word2vec library and worsened the search duration overall. 

Samples: Could not load word2vec and start the search. Reverted to previous heuristic.

## Milestones
### Milestone 1
Implement a keyword heuristic. Pages that are closer in similarity to the finish pages are given a higher score. 
**Deadline**: April 4, 2024
**Status**: Done
### Milestone 2
Implement category matching, where categories of the start and finish pages are also part of the heuristic. Higher scores are given to pages that are the same category as the finish page.
**Deadline**: April 18, 2024
**Status**: Done
### Milestone 3
Implement a bidirectional search. Ex// bidirectional search, removing references and unnecessary text, etc
**Deadline**: April 25, 2024
**Status**: Done
### Milestone 4
Try implementing word2vec and keyword heuristic libraries instead of the current search utilizing keywords from titles
**Deadline**: May 2, 2024
**Status**: Done
